# Hello Sidewalk!

### Open Sidewalk Graph for Accessible Trip Planning:

**Open Sidewalk Graph for Accessible Trip Planning** is an information challenge to design an open source software toolkit and set of algorithms to help those with limited mobility plan a commute. By developing city-wide sidewalk accessibility analytics and applying routing algorithms, the project hopes to assemble disconnected sidewalk segments into a coherent graph, providing rapid and convenient routing for those with limited mobility that avoids steep hills, uncrossable intersections, stairs, or construction that blocks sidewalks.
